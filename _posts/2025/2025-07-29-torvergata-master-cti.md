As part of the **Master in Cybersecurity and Privacy** at the University of Rome *Tor Vergata*, I deliver advanced modules focusing on **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**, the **Dark Web ecosystem**, and **Ransomware operations**.

### Educational Scope

The lectures are tailored to a diverse audience of IT professionals, legal experts, and government employees, with the objective of bridging technical depth with applied intelligence methodologies. My teaching covers:

- CTI lifecycle and intelligence types
- Indicator taxonomy and actor profiling
- Underground economy and ransomware gangs
- OSINT and dark web investigation methods
- Live demonstrations with tools like Shodan, IntelX, HaveIBeenPwned, VirusTotal, and others
- Threat actor tracking and infrastructure mapping

The course is designed to provide actionable skills to monitor and analyze cybercriminal activities through real-world scenarios and offensive simulation insights.

### Focus Topics

- Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model
- Initial Access Brokers and affiliate networks
- Data leak sites and cryptocurrency laundering
- Hands-on labs with dark web crawlers and intelligence platforms

### Integration with Research

These teaching activities are enriched by my ongoing PhD research at the University of Sannio, which focuses on:

- Attacker-centric threat intelligence
- Tracking ransomware financial flows
- Machine learning applied to threat classification
- TIPs and OSINT microservice orchestration

### Professional Engagement

Alongside my academic role, I serve as **Chief Information Security Officer at Würth Italia** and **Director of the CTI group “DarkLab” at RedHotCyber**. This allows me to translate field experience directly into classroom insights, creating a well-rounded and impactful learning experience.
