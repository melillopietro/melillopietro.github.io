As part of the [Executive Master in Cybersecurity](https://iusi.eu/corsi/executive-master-sicurezza-informatica/) offered by IUSI â€“ Istituto Universitario di Scienze Informatiche, I was entrusted with delivering the **practical laboratory module on penetration testing**.

## Course Context

The executive master aims to train high-level cybersecurity professionals by combining theoretical knowledge with hands-on technical training. My contribution focused on enabling participants to gain operational skills through practical sessions on real-world vulnerable systems.

## Module Description: Penetration Testing Lab

The lab was designed to simulate real attack scenarios, allowing students to:

- Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in isolated environments
- Understand and apply the phases of a penetration test
- Document technical findings effectively

### Topics Covered:

- Methodologies: PTES, OSSTMM, and OWASP Testing Guide
- Reconnaissance and enumeration techniques
- Exploitation of known CVEs
- Privilege escalation on Windows and Linux
- Post-exploitation and lateral movement
- Writing a professional pentest report

## Tools and Platforms

During the sessions, the following platforms and tools were used:

- **Kali Linux**, **Parrot OS**, and **Metasploit Framework**
- **Burp Suite**, **Nmap**, **Enum4linux**, **Impacket**
- **Hack The Box**-like custom vulnerable machines

## Goals and Outcomes

By the end of the lab, participants were able to:

- Conduct structured penetration tests on target systems
- Analyze and exploit common vulnerabilities (e.g., misconfigurations, outdated software, weak credentials)
- Demonstrate attack paths from external recon to system compromise

## About the Executive Master

The IUSI Executive Master in Cybersecurity targets IT professionals, auditors, risk managers, and law enforcement. It blends managerial and technical aspects of cyber defense with a strong focus on operational resilience.
