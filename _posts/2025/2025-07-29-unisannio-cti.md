As part of my academic and professional commitment to advancing cyber threat intelligence, I am currently engaged as a **PhD student and university lecturer at the University of Sannio (Unisannio)**. My focus includes delivering specialized lectures and conducting research on:

- **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**
- **Dark Web Intelligence**
- **Ransomware ecosystems and operations**

### Teaching Activities

I provide structured lectures to students in the "Security of Networks and Software Systems" course. The curriculum includes both theoretical foundations and operational aspects of CTI, covering:

- Threat Intelligence lifecycle
- Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and their classification
- OSINT and CLOSINT data acquisition
- Threat modeling and actor profiling
- Ransomware groups and their monetization models
- Tools to support CTI (TIPs, Shodan, VirusTotal, IntelX, HaveIBeenPwned, Dark Market crawlers)

The didactic material is supported by real-world case studies and technical demonstrations, including curated slides on [Fundamentals of Cyber Threat Intelligence] and [Ransomware Analysis], enhancing the students’ ability to bridge theory with practice.

### Research Focus

My PhD research delves into attacker-centric CTI, with particular emphasis on:

- Clustering ransomware gangs based on TTPs and cryptocurrency flows
- Monitoring threat actor infrastructure across surface and dark web
- Evaluating threat intelligence platforms and their OSINT integration capabilities
- Enhancing CTI automation through AI/ML models

This research has resulted in the development of customized tools and microservices to automate the collection, enrichment, and prioritization of cyber threat data.

### Academic Collaboration

I actively collaborate with:
- **Prof. Corrado Aaron Visaggio**, faculty lead for CTI research at Unisannio
- **JanaraLab**, the local cybersecurity research group
- **RedHotCyber (DarkLab)**, where I serve as Director of Threat Intelligence

My lectures and projects aim to foster a new generation of cyber analysts and researchers, equipped to handle today’s evolving cyber threat landscape.
