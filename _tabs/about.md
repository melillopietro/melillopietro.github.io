My name is **Pietro Melillo**, and I have been working for several years in the field of **cybersecurity**, with a specific focus on **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)**, security governance, and advanced threat analysis.

I currently serve as **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** at **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, where I am responsible for defining and overseeing the company’s cybersecurity strategy across multiple business entities. My role includes regulatory compliance—particularly with the **NIS2 Directive**—as well as the implementation and continuous improvement of international standards such as **ISO/IEC 27001**. I also lead enterprise-wide initiatives in incident response, vulnerability management, security awareness, and AI governance, ensuring alignment between cybersecurity controls, regulatory obligations, and business objectives.

In parallel, I am a **PhD Researcher in Cyber Threat Intelligence** at the **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}**, where my research focuses on the **ransomware ecosystem**, **dark web dynamics**, and **data-driven models for threat analysis and prediction**. My academic work combines empirical analysis, threat intelligence methodologies, and applied research aimed at improving the understanding and anticipation of complex cyber threats.

Alongside my research activities, I am involved in academic teaching at several Italian universities, including **:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}** and Unisannio. I deliver specialized courses on **Cyber Threat Intelligence**, **dark web analysis**, and **cybercrime**, with an emphasis on bridging theoretical frameworks and real-world operational practices.

I am also the **Director of the CTI group “DarkLab”** at **:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}**, where I coordinate research, monitoring, and dissemination activities focused on emerging threats, underground ecosystems, and the evolution of criminal activity in cyberspace.

A detailed overview of my professional certifications is available in the dedicated [Certifications](/certifications/) section.
