My name is **Pietro Melillo**, and I have been working for several years in the field of **cybersecurity**, with a specific focus on **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** and advanced threat analysis.

I currently serve as **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)** at **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**, where I am responsible for defining and overseeing the company’s cybersecurity strategy. My role includes ensuring compliance with the **NIS2 Directive** and coordinating the adoption and maintenance of international standards such as **ISO/IEC 27001**.

In parallel, I am a **PhD Researcher in Cyber Threat Intelligence** at the **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}**, where my research focuses on ransomware-related threats, the dark web ecosystem, and data-driven approaches to attack analysis and prediction.

Alongside my research activities, I am involved in academic teaching at several Italian universities, including **:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}** and Unisannio, delivering specialized courses on **Cyber Threat Intelligence**, **dark web analysis**, and **cybercrime**, with a strong emphasis on real-world case studies and operational perspectives.

I am also the **Director of the CTI group “DarkLab”** at **:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}**, where I coordinate research, monitoring, and dissemination activities focused on emerging threats, underground ecosystems, and criminal activity in cyberspace.
