My name is **Pietro Melillo**, and I have been working for years in the field of **cybersecurity**, with a particular focus on **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** and advanced threat analysis.

I currently serve as the **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at WÜRTH Italy**, where I lead the company's cybersecurity strategy, ensure compliance with the NIS2 directive, and coordinate the adoption of international standards such as ISO/IEC 27001.

In parallel, I am a **PhD Researcher in Cyber Threat Intelligence** at the University of Sannio, conducting research on ransomware phenomena, the dark web ecosystem, and predictive attack modeling.

Academically, I lecture at several Italian universities (including Tor Vergata and Unisannio), delivering specialized courses on CTI, the dark web, and cybercrime analysis.

I am also the **Director of the CTI group “DarkLab” at Red Hot Cyber**, where I coordinate research, dissemination, and monitoring activities focused on emerging threats in underground environments and the criminal cyberspace.
